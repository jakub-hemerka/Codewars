# Power tower modulo m

[Codewars URL](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a08b22b32b8b96f4700001c)

The goal of this kata is to write a function `tower(base, height, modulus)` that returns `base ** base ** ... ** base`, with `height` occurrences of `base`, modulo `modulus`. (`**` is the power operator in Python, in case this kata gets translated.) As input constraints, we have:
```
1 <= base < 1e20
0 <= height < 1e20
1 <= modulus < 1e7
```
If `modulus == 1`, the returned value should be `0` irrespective of the values of the two other parameters. Otherwise, if `base == 1` or `height == 0`, the output should be `1`, and, if `height == 1`, the output should be `base % modulus`.

For example, `tower(2, 4, 1000)` should return `536`, because: `2 ** 2 ** 2 ** 2 == 2 ** (2 ** (2 ** 2)) == 65536` and `65536 % 1000 == 536`.

Note that the power operator is right-associative, meaning that `a ** b ** c` is computed `a ** (b ** c)` and not `(a ** b) ** c`. For example, `2 ** 2 ** 4 == 2 ** 16 == 65536` and `2 ** 2 ** 4 != 4 ** 4 == 256`.

Note also that `tower(b, h, m) = pow(b, tower(b, h - 1, m), m)` is not a correct recursive relationship. For example, `tower(13, 3, 31) != pow(13, tower(13, 2, 31), 31)`. However, `tower(13, 3, 31) == pow(13, tower(13, 2, 30), 31)`.

There are more examples in the example tests.

## Some number theory
Since Codewars is for programmers and not mathematicians, I thought that I would provide a minimum of number theory background to let programmers get started.

Given a positive integer `m > 1`, we can form the set of all integers between `1` and `m` that are coprime with `m`. This set can be defined with code as `G = {i for i in range(1, m) if gcd(i, m) == 1}`, where `gcd(a, b)` returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. The number of elements in this set is sometimes denoted `phi(m)`, sometimes `totient(m)`.

For example, let `m = 15`. The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5. Let's start with the set {1, 2, ..., 15} and remove all the multiples of 3. Every 3rd element is a multiple of 3 and, if they are removed, we are left with `15 * 2 / 3 = 10` elements. Next remove all multiples of 5. Every 5th element is a multiple of 5 and, if they are removed, we are left with `10 * 4 / 5 = 8` elements. So, `totient(15) = 8`. The set of elements that are coprime with 15 is `G = {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14}`, and, as can be observed, it contains 8 elements. Now, take any element of `G` and raise it to the first 8 powers modulo 15. For example, the powers of 7 modulo 15 are 7, 4, 13, 1, 7, 4, 13, 1, and the powers of 2 modulo 15 are 2, 4, 8, 1, 2, 4, 8, 1. The powers of any element of `G` have a cycle length that divides `totient(m)` and the cycle always ends with 1. In other words, for any `b` in `G` and `q, r` such that `0 <= q and 0 <= r < totient(m)`,

- `b ** (q * totient(m) + r) % m == b ** r % m`.

This allows us to reduce large powers to powers that are less than `totient(m)`. What if we choose a number `b` that is not in `G`. For example, let `b = 3`. Then the powers of 3 modulo 15 are 3, 9, 12, 6, 3, 9, 12, 6. The cycle length is still a divisor of `totient(m)`, but the cycle does not end with 1. This implies that for `b` not in `G`, the statement in the above bullet does not hold. However, it can be amended slighly, so that we can still reduce large powers to smaller powers.
